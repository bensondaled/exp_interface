what i did:
(the usual fix for vcvarsall - just google it, this machine is using VS12=2013)
changed everything (visualstudio, python, flycapture api to same architecture = 32bit)
chose 32 b/c pythonxy only comes that way
--this installed fine
--but imported with dll error
then changed env variable "Path" to include all directories with dll files or object files in the flycapture api folders (in program files x86)
--all worked from here
