what i did:
(the usual fix for vcvarsall - just google it, this machine is using VS12=2013)
changed everything (visualstudio, python, flycapture api to same architecture = 32bit)
chose 32 b/c pythonxy only comes that way
--this installed fine
--but imported with dll error
then changed env variable "Path" to include all directories with dll files or object files in the flycapture api folders (in program files x86)
(see path below)
-all worked from here

edited flycapture2.pyx to add functions



added these to "Path" env variable on windows: C:\Program Files\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\lib64\C;C:\Program Files\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\include\C;C:\Program Files (x86)\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\bin\FC1\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\lib;C:\Program Files (x86)\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\lib\C;C:\Program Files (x86)\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\lib\FC1
